#k-th order Markov Models for metagenomics

The objective of this project is to provide tools for, on one hand, generating k-th order Markov Models from genomes (available at the NCBI), and, on the other hand, scoring a file of reads in FASTA format against the previously obtained models.

This project has been developed as part of ongoing research at the Bioinformatics Research Group (BioRG) from Florida International University (FIU). This group is headed by Prof. Giri Narasimhan. The C++ code was programmed by Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido (Ph.D. in Computer Science) and the Cuda code by Trevor Cickosvki (Ph.D. in Computer Science).
